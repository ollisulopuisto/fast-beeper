# Send Later end-to-end tests

Runs the real `solmu-scheduler` daemon, built from this repo's sources,
against a stub Beeper Server API, and checks the behaviors Send Later's
safety rules promise. No network, no credentials, no real chats.

    contrib/send-later/e2e/run-e2e.sh

What the suite covers (25 checks):

- Socket hardening: POSTs bearing an Origin header, a missing control
  token, or a non-JSON content type are refused.
- Schedule and deliver: the due message goes out exactly once, with the
  exact words, and the returned message id is recorded.
- Cancel before due never sends; edits change what is delivered.
- A definite rejection (HTTP error) marks the item Failed with the reason
  and is never retried automatically.
- kill -9 mid-send: the item stays claimed on disk, restarts as Uncertain,
  and is never resent automatically. `reconcile` checks the chat history
  (`found` settles it Sent, `not_found` leaves it Uncertain) and refuses
  non-Uncertain items. `retry` of an Uncertain item needs an explicit
  `{"confirm_duplicate":true}` because a copy may already have reached
  the chat; a confirmed retry resends.
- A clean restart still fires queued items on time.

Pieces:

- `run-e2e.sh` builds the daemon in a small harness crate under
  `/tmp/scheduler-harness` (overridable with `SL_E2E_HARNESS`) so the app
  itself does not need to compile, then invokes `cases.sh`.
- `cases.sh` starts `stub.py` and the daemon on localhost and asserts the
  behaviors above. Override `SL_E2E_WORK`, `SL_E2E_STUB_PORT`,
  `SL_E2E_DAEMON_PORT` for parallel runs.
- `stub.py` is a minimal Beeper Server API: chat lookup, message search,
  and sends, with `hang`/`reject` modes driven by `$SL_E2E_WORK/mode` to
  exercise crash and rejection paths.

The daemon's own unit tests (`src/scheduler.rs`, `src/scheduler_api.rs`)
cover the same rules at the module level; this suite proves the assembled
binary keeps them.
