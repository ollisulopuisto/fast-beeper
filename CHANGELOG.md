# Changelog

Newest first. One `## <version>` section per release, bullets under it;
the app shows the sections newer than the version the user last
acknowledged, and the latest sections when opened from Help. The
`## Unreleased` section collects notes for the next release and is never
shown automatically; move its bullets under the release version when the
version in Cargo.toml is bumped.

## Unreleased

- Conversation day separators now show Today, Yesterday and Day before yesterday, then short numeric dates in the system locale's order. Dates from another year include the full year. Finnish regions show Tänään, Eilen and Toissapäivänä. Bubble clocks and chat-row timestamps are unchanged.
- The four-way queue toggle can show chat counts for All, Unread, Reply later and Read later. Settings > Chats > Show queue counts is on by default; turn it off for icons only. Counts follow the current search and filters, count linked people once, and are separate from unread-message counts.

- macOS: explicitly subscribe the late-installed Cmd-Tab activation handler so it can request a new window after Close keeps Solmu running in the background. Dock reopen stays separate.

- Sidebar shortcuts follow the visible queue: Cmd+Option+3 (Ctrl+Alt+3 elsewhere) selects Reply later, and 5 toggles Favorites only. Network tooltips now show Option/Alt without Command/Ctrl. Fixed the off-Mac Ctrl+Shift+1 Chats collision and corrected shortcut help and guide references.

- Chat-list redesign: Search first, then Chats beside an aligned four-way icon queue (All, Unread, Reply later, Read later). Filters combines chat type, favorites, labels, Unreplied and network/account scope; the bottom New message button stays fixed even with no results. Search keeps the selected scope and offers a count of available matches outside it, without listing them until the scope is cleared. Keyboard filter/network/favorite digits keep their assignments.
- Incoming group messages use a fixed avatar gutter and a straight bubble-body column, including follow-up messages from the same sender.

- Clean URL labels on shared links (including Instagram reels) now hide the duplicate parenthesized destination, like named links. Clicking or Copy URL keeps the complete destination and its query parameters; message copy/export keeps the original text.

- Copy image and Save as now work on downloaded attachments in Beeper mode, even while disconnected. Failed decode, clipboard writes and file saves show an error instead of silently doing nothing.

- Message timestamps, day separators and date labels follow the OS regional locale independently of the app language: a Finnish region reads "eilen 20:13", "toissa päivänä 20:13" and "14.11.2023", a US region "Yesterday 10:13 PM" and "11/14/2023". The 12/24-hour clock keeps following the OS clock setting.
- The Dock/taskbar unread badge and the Unread filter now count the same chats: channels and chats from Beeper accounts hidden from the inbox no longer leave a ghost number on the icon. Muted chats still appear under Unread without raising the badge.
- Settings: clearer spacing between sections, consistent row rhythm, and each Beeper account's technical details (account ID, backend, bridge status) grouped under an Advanced heading inside the account panel instead of crowding its title.
- Cmd+D toggles the right-hand info sidebar. Cmd+B still toggles the chat list; Cmd+I still marks Reply later.
- Links whose separators arrive entity-escaped from Beeper Server (Dropbox share links among them) now render and open with a plain `&` instead of a literal `&amp;`. The repair is scoped to link addresses - one level - and text outside links keeps its entities byte-for-byte. Diagnosed from a live payload probe.
- Named links show their title instead of a long raw URL; hover reveals the full address. The message menu now offers "Copy URL to clipboard" for named and standalone links, preserving the full target including query parameters.
- The chat list has more breathing room: default rows are 80 points tall instead of 68, with the same avatars and two-line previews. Settings > Beeper view > Compact chat list keeps the smaller 56-point rows.

## v0.22.0

- Link a person's chats from Contact info: a searchable picker suggests name matches across networks, and the linked conversation shows who sent each message and on which network.
- The left rail is a single compact icon column: favorites and pinned chats are avatar chips with unread badges, filters are one icon row, and networks sit as plates at the bottom with right-click account scoping.
- Voice notes can be transcribed entirely on your own local speech services (no cloud), with a per-message transcription language override from the message menu.
- The conversation background picks up a light tint of the open chat's network color, and each Beeper account can have its own background and conversation theme, linked view included.
- Pinned chats keep their normal row in the chat list as well as their rail shortcut.
- Shortcuts: Command+1..9 opens the nth favorite, Option+1..n picks a filter.
- Quote cards show the original message's excerpt when it is already loaded, and Signal group mentions render as proper chips with real member names.
- Hide and mute indefinitely now holds locally and tells you when the bridge does not confirm the change.
- Send Later: adding a message no longer kills the scheduler, setup failures name the failing stage, and a resend that could duplicate a message asks for explicit confirmation.
- Clicking the Dock icon brings the window forward again on the packaged app.
- Connection warnings in a chat collapse to one line per distinct problem, with the full text on hover.
- Networking update: connections no longer hang on networks with broken IPv6, plus a TLS verification fix (ureq 3.5).

## v0.21.0

- Command palette (Ctrl+P): find chats, apply list filters and run common actions from one keyboard-first overlay.
- Combined sidebar: network and account filters moved into the filter chip row, pinned chats show as regular rows at the top of the list, and Calls stays reachable in the rail with Beeper accounts.
- The chat list's edge can be dragged to resize it.
- Attachment uploads to WhatsApp no longer send the request shape that was rejected; a failed send keeps the staged files.
- The sidebar restores correctly in narrow windows and with the list hidden, and settings rows no longer cut their titles short.
